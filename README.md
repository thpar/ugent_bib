## UGent Bibliography ###

This Drupal module creates a block that can be added to any node or user-page. If it can find a field `field_ugent_id`, 
it will display the publications by this author, if any. If no such field is found, the Default UGent ID for the site is used,
which can be set in the configuration options. 

The module also offers a page `publications` which also renders the publications of the Default UGent ID.
